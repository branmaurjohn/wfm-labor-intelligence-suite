# Synthetic Data Disclaimer

This repository uses **synthetic, randomly generated data** designed to resemble
typical workforce management (WFM) datasets (schedules, timecards, org hierarchy, paycodes).

- **No real employee data** is included.
- **No PHI/PII** is included.
- **No customer/environment identifiers** (facility codes, tenant URLs, dataset names, etc.) are included.

All examples and outputs are intended for demonstration of:
- UKG Pro WFM analytics patterns
- BigQuery-style transformation logic
- Power BI semantic modeling patterns
- Python-based analysis and visualization techniques
